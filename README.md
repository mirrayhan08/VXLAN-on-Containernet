# VXLAN-on-Mininet
The objective of the project is to access the file server from the access network through a secure network tunnel. There are three access networks created in our network topology. One host from each access network can communicate with each other through the secure communication channel as like a local network and this can be achieved by the VXLAN. But the access between the hosts in the same access network segment is restricted by packet filtering.
