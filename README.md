# VXLAN-on-Mininet
The objective of project is to access the file server from access network through a secure network tunnel. There are three access networks created in our network topology. One host from each accessP a g e 4 | 22 network can communicate with each other through the secure communication channel as like a local network and this can be achieved by the VXLAN. But the access between the hosts in the same access network segment is restricted by packet filtering.
